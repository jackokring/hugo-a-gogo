# Hugo-a-GoGo

## Features

## Installation

It's kept as part of a repo to have the example in context. Occasionally files
will be back copied into `themes` from the site. Then the site becomes just a
temporary override of the theme by parts.

## Configuration

## Notes on `layouts/`

### `home.html` overrides `section.html` in root `content/`
