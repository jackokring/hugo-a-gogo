    <main> <p>Beep, beep. Registered number <strong>09861978</strong> bringing you information and wonder
from the frontiers of computers and natural science. This site is logged so if
you are not happy about cookies or data protection makes you wince and run to
the moon, please leave. Big brother knew you were going to visit here so the
opt out button is the same one that closes the browser. Fabulous. So now that&rsquo;s
done with, we can begin. Don&rsquo;t be naughty now, save it up for later as you might
need it. I can&rsquo;t enforce my service provider on opt in, although this page packs
Google login cookies from KRT.</p>
<p>This site is mainly built with <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hugo</a>
 the static site
builder, with a theme from scratch as it develops. It takes a few days of
competence to work out where all the things go, and what edits do what, but it&rsquo;s
not bad for a development system for blog style sites. I use other tools too so
if you need work doing, or things seeing, you can contact K Ring Technologies
via <code>jackokring@gmail.com</code> and someone possibly important might get back to you.</p>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><h2 id="st">st</h2>
<p>The suckless terminal. It&rsquo;s ideally small to bake in a nerd font, and remove
non UTF-8 mode, and the alt code Latin code page. On a Chromebook this is
important as the Crostini terminal doesn&rsquo;t have nerd font abilities. I then
launch <code>nvim</code> inside <code>st</code> to obtain a local and an <code>ssh -X</code> remote fonted
edit experience. Nice.</p>
<h2 id="rofi">rofi</h2>
<p>A nice hot keyed quick launch selector. After a bit of setup lots can be
placed for access by <code>rofi -show combi</code>, the mix together mode. I also added
a plugin template called <code>a</code> as C makes <code>a.out</code> for adding in more modes.</p></div>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><p><a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a>
 is a static site templating builder used here.
It works well. It seems similar to how github pages works, but is written in go
instead of ruby. It does take a little while to scan the documentation and
setup, as some of the more complex themes don&rsquo;t work with some integration
solutions such as <strong>CloudFlare</strong>. Simple truths such as a theme being a fallback
site make sense, as after some time migrating the templating to the theme
and just using the site layouts for overrides just makes sense.</p></div>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><p>The excellent <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neovim</a>
 has improved a lot since the older
<code>vim</code> and even the original <code>vi</code>. It now includes Lua scripting as well as
the more obscure Vim Script. It is best using some extra configuration of which
<a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LazyVim</a>
 I have found to be very useful.</p>
<p>As a fast loading editor with treesitter and various LSP servers, it&rsquo;s nice,
although the way &ldquo;modes&rdquo; work is not your usual editor way. It has the speed
advantage over <code>VSCode</code> and also will load files over an <code>SSH</code> connection
whereas <code>VSCode</code> just freezes. I tried <code>Emacs</code> for a while and have used it
back in the 90s. I found the LISP configuration more annoying than using
Lua for configuration. Also <code>LazyVim</code> really solves the initial setup problems.</p></div>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><h2 id="circa-2024">Circa 2024</h2>
<p>K Ring Technologies became a Ltd company after a number of years being a
&ldquo;trading as&rdquo; name for the founder&rsquo;s contracting internet and software work.
Work became infrequent and declined over the COVID 19 years, and is just an
R and D shell circa 2024. It has no financial liabilities to creditors, and so
it was decided to continue the company for the future.</p>
<p>The founder Simon Jackson has an interest in computer technology and
programming, and maintains a deep interest in physics, chemistry and
mathematics. It is not uncommon for him to watch highly technical presentations
on many science subjects, and he even has his own theoretical physics theories
which really started with <strong>Uncertain Geometry</strong>.</p></div>
