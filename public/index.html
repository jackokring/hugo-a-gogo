<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><p>So the Debian container on my Chromebook became slow and large. Things needed
to be done. So I deleted it and went full on with the latest release of
<strong>Termux</strong> from the play store and installed some things like Neovim. Then
I had a little play, and some more things were installed.</p>
<p>Excellent. It is much faster, does have a few &ldquo;unique&rdquo; ways of doing things,
but it does have rust working, and a few strange things to do with lua
in Neovim due to how the Mason language server has to be installed from
the package manager and not Mason. Ah, all is well bar a few start up errors
along with a little more learning needed for clipboard interaction.</p></div>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><p>Consider the uncertainty of the radius of a black hole. As a time uncertainty
has a commutator with energy uncertainty, and a time for a velocity is a
distance, then the radius has a gravitational energy-momentum uncertainty.
That is to say the gravity has an uncertainty for an exact radius. This leads
to an understanding that the radius has an uncertainty either side of the
precise radius solution by General Relativity. An uncertainty inside, and an
uncertainty outside. So where does the holographic surface fit in on a surface
of a given radius? Perhaps it&rsquo;s two surfaces, or two expectations of radius
average, given that the inside and outside are from a physics prospective
treated as two sides of space-time flowing at the speed of light precisely at
the speed of light.</p></div>

<p>A compact library to do DOM processing based on tags. A similar challenge to
get it server side, but it would make for more expressive terse code
if the server had a DOM, but it doesn&rsquo;t. I suppose that&rsquo;s lucky. It&rsquo;s not
as though all it does can&rsquo;t be done otherways, it&rsquo;s just so compact to write
without all the boilerplate duplication. I&rsquo;m sure with DOM templates it will
be efficient to implement things.</p></div>

just left the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> hell, which can be ignored quite a bit, needing

<p>If you need graphical design, maybe it&rsquo;s possible, but there is no artist on
call. This doesn&rsquo;t mean UI/UX optimization is a skill lacking here. The
internet has been used here since 1995 from a web build prospective.</p></div>

<div data-pagefind-ignore="all"><p>The excellent <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neovim</a>
 has improved a lot since the older
<code>vim</code> and even the original <code>vi</code>. It now includes Lua scripting as well as
the more obscure Vim Script. It is best using some extra configuration of which
<a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LazyVim</a>
 I have found to be very useful.</p>
<p>As a fast loading editor with treesitter and various LSP servers, it&rsquo;s nice,
although the way &ldquo;modes&rdquo; work is not your usual editor way. It has the speed
advantage over <code>VSCode</code> and also will load files over an <code>SSH</code> connection
whereas <code>VSCode</code> just freezes. I tried <code>Emacs</code> for a while and have used it
back in the 90s. I found the LISP configuration more annoying than using
Lua for configuration. Also <code>LazyVim</code> really solves the initial setup problems.</p></div>

<p>K Ring Technologies became a Ltd company after a number of years being a
&ldquo;trading as&rdquo; name for the founder&rsquo;s contracting internet and software work.
Work became infrequent and declined over the COVID 19 years, and is just an
R and D shell circa 2024. It has no financial liabilities to creditors, and so
it was decided to continue the company for the future.</p>
<p>The founder Simon Jackson has an interest in computer technology and
programming, and maintains a deep interest in physics, chemistry and
mathematics. It is not uncommon for him to watch highly technical presentations
on many science subjects, and he even has his own theoretical physics theories
which really started with <strong>Uncertain Geometry</strong>.</p></div>
