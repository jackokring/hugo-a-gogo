      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider the uncertainty of the radius of a black hole. As a time uncertainty&#xA;has a commutator with energy uncertainty, and a time for a velocity is a&#xA;distance, then the radius has a gravitational energy-momentum uncertainty.&#xA;That is to say the gravity has an uncertainty for an exact radius. This leads&#xA;to an understanding that the radius has an uncertainty either side of the&#xA;precise radius solution by General Relativity. An uncertainty inside, and an&#xA;uncertainty outside. So where does the holographic surface fit in on a surface&#xA;of a given radius? Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s two surfaces, or two expectations of radius&#xA;average, given that the inside and outside are from a physics prospective&#xA;treated as two sides of space-time flowing at the speed of light precisely at&#xA;the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
