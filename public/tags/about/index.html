<h2 id="circa-2024">Circa 2024</h2>
<p>K Ring Technologies became a Ltd company after a number of years being a
&ldquo;trading as&rdquo; name for the founder&rsquo;s contracting internet and software work.
Work became infrequent and declined over the COVID 19 years, and is just an
R and D shell circa 2024. It has no financial liabilities to creditors, and so
it was decided to continue the company for the future. The founder Simon Jackson
has an interest in computer technology and programming, and maintains a
deep interest in physics, chemistry and mathematics. It is not uncommon for him
to watch highly technical presentations on many science subjects, and he even
has his own theoretical physics theories which really started with
<strong>Uncertain Geometry</strong>. That theory being about consequences of theories of
motion independent of mass, using velocity as a phase space dimension along
with position. The 13 D (26 degrees of freedom) have possibilities.
He also has a composite gluon theory where 2 half gluon particles combine in
pairs to replace the &ldquo;approximate&rdquo; 8 gluon varieties. He maintains an interest
in data compression algorithms, AI and some methods of mathematical integration.</p>   </main>
