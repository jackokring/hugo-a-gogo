      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;circa-2024&#34;&gt;Circa 2024&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;K Ring Technologies became a Ltd company after a number of years being a&#xA;&amp;ldquo;trading as&amp;rdquo; name for the founder&amp;rsquo;s contracting internet and software work.&#xA;Work became infrequent and declined over the COVID 19 years, and is just an&#xA;R and D shell circa 2024. It has no financial liabilities to creditors, and so&#xA;it was decided to continue the company for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The founder Simon Jackson has an interest in computer technology and&#xA;programming, and maintains a deep interest in physics, chemistry and&#xA;mathematics. It is not uncommon for him to watch highly technical presentations&#xA;on many science subjects, and he even has his own theoretical physics theories&#xA;which really started with &lt;strong&gt;Uncertain Geometry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
