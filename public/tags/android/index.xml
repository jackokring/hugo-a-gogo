      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the Debian container on my Chromebook became slow and large. Things needed&#xA;to be done. So I deleted it and went full on with the latest release of&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Termux&lt;/strong&gt; from the play store and installed some things like Neovim. Then&#xA;I had a little play, and some more things were installed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excellent. It is much faster, does have a few &amp;ldquo;unique&amp;rdquo; ways of doing things,&#xA;but it does have rust working, and a few strange things to do with lua&#xA;in Neovim due to how the Mason language server has to be installed from&#xA;the package manager and not Mason. Ah, all is well bar a few start up errors&#xA;along with a little more learning needed for clipboard interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
