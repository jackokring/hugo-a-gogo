So I've installed hugo and I'm trying it out for possible use for the company site. The template has some strange practices, but looks good in gruvebox colours.
I'm sure it quite extendable, and it allows me to try out something other than PHP/WordPress. I've never liked PHP that much, and beyond some flexible plugins
PHP is still not great in my opinion. I'm moving to Neovim too. With LazyVim it's not too bad, although it does need a little "moulding" to my desires.

I'm sure I'll let you know how it goes. If I don't die of hybrid toml-json first.
