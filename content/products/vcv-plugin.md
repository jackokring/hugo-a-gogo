An audio plugin of virtual Eurorack modules. A free download for **VCV Rack**
written in C++ under an MIT licence. Downloads are in the tens of thousands
and as such it's KRT's most popular software.

Download [here](https://library.vcvrack.com/KRTPluginA) by subscribing and
then updating the library from within the VCV application. There is a free
version of VCV available from the [VCV homepage](https://vcvrack.com/) as
well as a pro version with a VST adapter for integration with your music
DAW. It's a very nice experimental audio platform with many third party
plugins.

The development SDK is also free, although some things like the GUI have a
licence requiring you not to sell plugins based on the free GUI components.
You can put forward plugins using your own graphics to sell via the VCV store.
