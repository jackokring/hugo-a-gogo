## Circa 2024

K Ring Technologies became a Ltd company after a number of years being a
"trading as" name for the founder's contracting internet and software work.
Work became infrequent and declined over the COVID 19 years, and is just an
R and D shell circa 2024. It has no financial liabilities to creditors, and so
it was decided to continue the company for the future.

The founder Simon Jackson has an interest in computer technology and
programming, and maintains a deep interest in physics, chemistry and
mathematics. It is not uncommon for him to watch highly technical presentations
on many science subjects, and he even has his own theoretical physics theories
which really started with **Uncertain Geometry**.

The theory is about consequences of theories of motion independent of mass,
using velocity as a phase space dimension along with position. The 13 D (26
degrees of freedom) have possibilities. He also has a composite gluon theory
where 2 half gluon particles combine in pairs to replace the "approximate" 8
gluon varieties.
