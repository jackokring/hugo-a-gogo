### Under Construction

### 🦍 Gorilla

Inspired by `ThePrimeagen` and his great work of art testing `Devin` just
before Christmas 2024. Also a good Unicode test of LV2 hosts. The details are
being worked out but expect another 3 plugins in the set of 4. It's like a
general template, but with some MIDI CC señor. If it was too logical, it would
lack the kind of uniqueness that might be worth a little. The plugin world is
a crowded place.

### 🎳 Dude

The classic Lebowski.

### ⚛️ Atom

An individual piece.

### ➗️ Heavy Division

A composure of sorts.
