K Ring Technologies can provide computer software coding from simple scripts
for productivity automation, to complex database driven website features.
Although there are some preferred technologies for new projects, any previous
technology is considered for maintenance of product, or even new build.

If you need graphical design, maybe it's possible, but there is no artist on
call. This doesn't mean UI/UX optimization is a skill lacking here. The
internet has been used here since 1995 from a web build prospective.

Skills from the founder since childhood computer access and an large library
resource of computer technical literature feeding the thirst for knowledge.
Effective systems analysis from waterfall and agile methodologies, along with
childhood introduction to pair programming as was often the case with limited
input keyboard numbers in the 1980s.

An extensive technical understanding of computer hardware from an Electrical
and Electronic prospective comes as standard which maybe of value in some
embedded firmware and electronic interfacing projects.
