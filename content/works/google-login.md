The google login is in progress and does not yet work. Your email is not on the
list, so no point in trying yet. Also there is as yet no logout link although
for testers the logout happens after one day. There is also nothing happening
in terms of extra features for logging in. This should change.

- A joypad adapter to tunnel through into a container to use with
  `doris.nvim`.
- A reverse proxy to tunnel `nvim` out of the container, and use the
  external browser as a `https` connection to the internet, so that `doris.nvim`
  may run some kind of BBS text service TUI.

There's things to be done.
