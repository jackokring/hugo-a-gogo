Beep, beep. Registered number **09861978** bringing you information and wonder
from the frontiers of computers and natural science. This site is logged so if
you are not happy about cookies or data protection makes you wince and run to
the moon, please leave. Big brother knew you were going to visit here so the
opt out button is the same one that closes the browser. Fabulous. So now that's
done with, we can begin. Don't be naughty now, save it up for later as you might
need it. I can't enforce my service provider on opt in, although this page packs
Google login cookies from KRT.

This site is mainly built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) the static site
builder, with a theme from scratch as it develops. It takes a few days of
competence to work out where all the things go, and what edits do what, but it's
not bad for a development system for blog style sites. I use other tools too so
if you need work doing, or things seeing, you can contact K Ring Technologies
via `jackokring@gmail.com` and someone possibly important might get back to you.
